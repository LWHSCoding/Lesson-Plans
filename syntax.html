<!--When the computer runs the code it does read comments
Comments are a good place to put nots and explinations about your code

<!--This document is a syntax document.
The goal of it is to explain the different parts of html and to also serve as a reference point if you ever forgot certain syntax.
Hopefuly you could also use it to solidify you're HTML knowledge.

<!--General:
HTML Documents are broken into a head, and a body
Always open tags like <tagname> and close tags with </tagname>
-->
<head>
  <!-- This is a font link. It imports fonts from google into our document-->
  <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,400' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>

</head>
<!--The style tag is where you can put all your styling for the document
Makes sure your style tag is out of your body. Style tags should go in between the head and the body.-->
<style>
/* Notice how comments are different in css.
This is because css is actually a different "language"
The standard syntax for css is as follows:*/


/*
The tag you would like to style would be your tagname. If you use p, it will style everything in p tags. If you use body, it will style everything in the body
tagname {
  style-type:preference;
}
Some examples are below
Make sure to include a semicolon after each line in css!

  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
